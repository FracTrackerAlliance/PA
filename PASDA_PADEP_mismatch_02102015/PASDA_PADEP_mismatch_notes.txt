This spreadsheet contains oil and gas well data from two sources that were expected to be identical, but were not.  The sources are the Pennsylania Department of Environmental Protection Spud Report (http://www.depreportingservices.state.pa.us/ReportServer/Pages/ReportViewer.aspx?/Oil_Gas/Spud_External_Data) and the Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access "Oil and Gas Locations" file (http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/MetadataDisplay.aspx?entry=PASDA&file=OilGasLocations2015_01.xml&dataset=283).
