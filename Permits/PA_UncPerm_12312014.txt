According to the PADEP (Source:  http://files.dep.state.pa.us/OilGas/BOGM/BOGMPortalFiles/OilGasReports/HelpDocs/Permits_Issued_Detail_Report_Help.pdf), a well is unconventional if the following conditions apply:  "An unconventional gas well is a well that is drilled into an Unconventional formation, which is defined as a geologic shale formation below the base of the Elk Sandstone or its geologic equivalent where natural gas generally cannot be produced except by horizontal or vertical well bores stimulated by hydraulic fracturing."  The majority of unconventioanl wells in Pennsylvania are drilled into the Marcellus Shale formation.
